# TopSort

Contains implementations of algorithms related to finding a topological sorting of a DAG.  Namely:
- Kahn's topological sorting algorithm.
- DFS-based topological sorting / cycle detection.
- Bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm to find the length of the longest path in a DAG.  
- Kosaraju's linear-time algorithm for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph.
