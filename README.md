# Graphs

A collection of some graph algorithms.  I've used these on various programming challenge websites, so they are in some sense rigorously tested.  Your mileage may vary and I would be curious to hear about any errors.  

The different directories contain implementations of:

- Kahn's topological sorting algorithm.
- Longest path in a DAG.  
- DFS-based topological sorting / cycle detection.
- Bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm to find the length of the longest path in a DAG.  
- Kosaraju's linear-time algorithm for finding the strongly connected components of a directed graph.
- Kruskal's minimal spanning tree algorithm.
- Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm (both heap-based and set-based).
- Bellman-Ford algorithm for minimal path trees with a given source vertex.
- An application of Bellman-Ford to finding arbitrage oppurtunities in exchange rate graphs.
- Dijkstra's algorithm for minimal path trees with a given source vertex (both heap-based and set-based).
- Pruning and BFS-based algorithms for finding the center(s) of a tree.
